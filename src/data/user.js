		description:
			"As a Informatic Engineering student, I’ve worked on various web development projects, both independently and as part of a team. These projects range from personal experiments and learning exercises to collaborative applications built during coding camps and academic programs. Many of these projects are open-source and available for others to explore, learn from, or contribute to. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and continuously seeking ways to improve both technically and creatively. I'm always open to feedback and collaboration, as I believe that working with others, sharing ideas, and learning from different perspectives are some of the best ways to grow as a developer.",
